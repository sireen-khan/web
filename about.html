    <p>Hi my name is gabby im a highschool student at an enginering school. I enjoy playing roleplay/simulator games with my friends on Roblox.

I think a game is a fun experience that you can play with by yourself or with friends.</p>

<h3>Raisa</h3>
<p>Welcome!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Raisa Ahsan (she/her/hers), I'm a freshman in highschool and I enjoy creating things. I have some experience with coding, working with electronics, robotics, and building in a workshop. I'm very artistic and I'm a quick learner.</p>
<h4>My definition of "games"</h4>
<p>To me, a game is an interactive activity that can be played alone or with multiple people, it typically has a goal that players target and a set of rules everyone has to abide by.<p>
    <h4>My favorite game</h4>
 <p>My current favorite game is Uno, it's a fun, interactive multiplayer game. The power cards within the deck play a crucial role in creating competition between players. The rules are relatively easy to learn and follow and the rounds aren't long and tiring.</p>
