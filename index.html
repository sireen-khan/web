        <h1>The 2012 OUtbreak</h1>

             Set in 2012: A group of 12 scientists visits an abandoned radioactive hospital to collect nuclear waste and process it in order to dispose of it safely and allow rebuilding in the area. They didn’t know that there was bacteria contaminating the halls of the hospital- so later, in the lab, when everyone took their suits off, the airborne bacteria spread from one team member who improperly wore their gear, to the whole team and they all became infected. When the bacteria multiplied and eventually settled in their brains, they turned into zombies with a human-like understanding of movement and behavior. There was a 13th scientist who was a part of their team but was unable to go with them to the hospital due to some health concerns, her genetics ended up being the reason behind her immunity to the zombie bacterium. When she realized what was going on, she alerted the whole building, all but 8 others became victims of the zombies. After evacuating and making base elsewhere, the 9 remaining human scientists became determined to kill the zombies and eradicate the bacteria by blowing up the labs.
