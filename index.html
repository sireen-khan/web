             Set in 2012: A group of 12 scientists visits an abandoned radioactive hospital to collect nuclear waste and process it in order to dispose of it safely and allow rebuilding in the area. They didn’t know that there was bacteria contaminating the halls of the hospital- so later, in the lab, when everyone took their suits off, the airborne bacteria spread from one team member who improperly wore their gear, to the whole team and they all became infected. When the bacteria multiplied and eventually settled in their brains, they turned into zombies with a human-like understanding of movement and behavior. There was a 13th scientist who was a part of their team but was unable to go with them to the hospital due to some health concerns, her genetics ended up being the reason behind her immunity to the zombie bacterium. When she realized what was going on, she alerted the whole building, all but 8 others became victims of the zombies. After evacuating and making base elsewhere, the 9 remaining human scientists became determined to kill the zombies and eradicate the bacteria by blowing up the labs.

        <h3>How this game helps the player?</h3>
</br>
        <p>
            The purpose of this game is we want to encourage team building  and communication as well as exercise. We will measure the impact of this game by seeing how often people communicate and speak to each other. We will also be monitoring the number of points each team earns. 
We can measure the players’ heart rates to determine whether participants are getting in some exercise.

       <h3>Flow and Fiero</h3>
</br>
<p>
           Definitions:
</p>
</br>
<p>
                  Flow: Does the player feel constantly productive, able to act and have those actions matter (advance their agenda) every turn? (productive)
                  Fiero: Multiple big victory moments for players? (rewarding)
</p>
</br>
<p>
       Flow in the game: Characters are always actively playing, trying to survive and kill zombies to get to the plant to end the zombies.
</p>
</br>
<p>
      Fiero in the game: After killing someone, either on your side or on thezombie sidem you get points tgat will help you advance your gun to get rid of zombies faster.
</p>

</br>
<h3>MECHANIC DESIGN</h3>
</br>
<p>
    Core Mechanic: Move up to move forward, down to move backward, left to aim left, right to aim right.
</p>
</br> 
<p> 
   Secondary Mechanic: Shake to send help signals to teammates and tap to shoot.
</p>
</br>
</br>

<p>
    Progression: Advancing through the levels by killing the zombie and getting to the plant to stop zombies from coming.
</p>

    Here is just one of the items I made.

<h4>Making the stop motion animation</h4>
<p>
    In this step, we started working with the dragonframe software and used the camera to take pictures of the settign and characters to make the stop motion animation.

<h5>End of Project Reflection</h5>
<p>
    In this section, I just reflected on what I did in this project.
</p>
</br>
<p>
    Here is my reflection
</p>
<p>
    Storyboard, Character, Set, and Mechanical Design - I helped take pictures of the different scenes as well as help make the parts we needed to make longer, longer. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
    Technology and Code - I used dragonframe software to help make the stop motion animation. I took pictures one by one, little by little, and after a while when all of the pictures were put together, the stop motion animation was created. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
    Social Impact, Audience, and 5 Whys - My work with the characters and technology helped create a physical animation that shows healthcare and how poor people don’t have enough money to pay for healthcare. The bed, the different images I used and the different character I used helped to show this.
