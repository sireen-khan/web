  <h3>PART 1: Game Concept Clarification</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Flow and Fiero</h4>
</br>
<p>
           Definitions:
</p>
</br>
<p>
                  Flow: Does the player feel constantly productive, able to act and have those actions matter (advance their agenda) every turn? (productive)
                  Fiero: Multiple big victory moments for players? (rewarding)
</p>
</br>
<p>
       Flow in the game: Characters are always actively playing, trying to survive and kill zombies to get to the plant to end the zombies.
</p>
</br>
<p>
      Fiero in the game: After killing someone, either on your side or on the zombie side, you get points that will help you advance your gun to get rid of zombies faster.
</p>

</br>
<h4>MECHANIC DESIGN</h4>
</br>
<p>
    Core Mechanic: Move up to move forward, down to move backward, left to aim left, right to aim right.
</p>
</br> 
<p> 
   Secondary Mechanic: Shake to send help signals to teammates and tap to shoot.
</p>
</br>
</br>

<p>
    Progression: Advancing through the levels by killing the zombie and getting to the plant to stop zombies from coming.
